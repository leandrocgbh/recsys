    "## 1. Recommender Systems Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender Systems help people to discover and/or find out items that they might like from a huge product/item catalog (Paradox of choice), by extracting their preferences from data to generate personalized recommendations. \n",
    "Imagine a platform like Netflix or Spotify without recommendations: Do you think it would be easy to find something you like without bigger effort? Even if you know what you like (some people don't), sometime you will be stucked in your own \"bubble\" and you will never get to know new cool things that you didn't even know that exists. So recommender systems are happy to provide recommedations that you already know and like, but they get even happier when they can find out something useful that you didn't know before!\n",
    "\n",
    "From user's perpecptive a recommender system is good because it can find the best items that fit to their preferences and from the company standpoint it is a way to generate more reveue by exposing users to items from the catalog that they are more likely to buy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So should we be focusing on profitable items or pure personalized recommendations? \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually we can use some financial information about the item such as its profit margin as a \"tiebreaker\" or a refinement of the final list of recommendations (prescriptive phase) but we need to be careful about this approach because if we recommend only expensive items to the users, they might have the felling we are not trying to improve and personalize their experience but only making money at their expense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a mix of personalized items, profitable items, trending items, new items, items on offer and any other kind of items we can think of is what we aim to achieve with good recommender systems and it is actually the challenging (and fun) part of building it!"

    "## 2. The main concerns we should be aware of \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Type of data used to learn the user's preferences\n",
    "The type of data we use to build recommendations is one of the most important point that we should take into account, as it is the core of any preference we can extract from users. We can either use `explicit` or `implicit` users signals/feedback data and each one has their pros and cons\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explicit\n",
    "* **Pros:**\n",
    "    * We know what each user likes and doesn't like and depending on the scale we can extract **how much** they like or not a particular item (e.g. five Stars ratings)\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "    * Sparse data issues as users tend to not rating every item consumed. If we compare the rated items from each user to the amount of items available, we have many missing values and that is an issue in user's preferences calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implicit\n",
    "* **Pros:**\n",
    "    * It is less sparse than explicit data if we are properly tracking user's behavior \n",
    "    * Less biased as it is not something the users are explicitly **saying** they like or not, but actually showing us with data! (Data is the customer's voice in a large scale).\n",
    "* **Cons:**\n",
    "    * We only know what the users like/consumed: Unlike explict data, users are not saying whether they like or not anything, and we cannot assume that an missing item hasn't been consumed yet because user doesn't like it or simply doesn't know it.\n",
    "    * Some signals could be noisy like `click` data as it is common to accidentally click on something that we didn't want to or even when is not a real person doing it like nots, web scrapers, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> For implicit data maybe it would be necessary to perform some transformations like square or square root in order to emphasize some signals over another (e.g. real interest clicks x misleading clicks). Therefore by transforming the data, some noisy trackings could be automatically ignored in the calculations keeping only the useful signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - How to measure recommendations quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most challenging part when it comes to RecSys and there are many current reaserches on this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Machine Learning Evaluation techinques are not as efficient on most of recommender systems because, in fact optmizing for prediction's accuracy would only make it possible to predict items that users have already consumed, but <u>helping users to find new items</u> they might like is the main goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part from [this post](https://gab41.lab41.org/recommender-systems-its-not-all-about-the-accuracy-562c7dceeaff#.5exl13wqv) ilustrates very well this point:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Imagine you are using a travel recommender system. Suppose all of the recommendations it gives to you are for places you have already traveled to. Even if the system were very good at ranking all of the places you have visited in order of preference, this still would be a poor recommender system. Would you use such a system?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some ways though, inherited from `information retrieval` field for measuring **rank quality** and it has been a commom way to compare and evaluate RecSys since the industry realized that optimizing for accuracy of ratings predicition is not the best approach to generate good recommendations, so they stoped looking for `ratings predictions` and started to optimize for `Top N Recommendations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Predicting ratings is still an important piece of the whole system as it can accurately understand people's tastes from the items consumed, however having (only) a good rating predictor doesn't mean that it's a good recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the evaluation into 2 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OFFLINE:** When you evaluate your recommendations using your own data (i.e. train and test splits) which is very close to others Machine Learning evaluation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ONLINE:** Using AB Tests/Field Tests to evaluate your recommendations by showing them to real users and measuring the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not independent of each other and it would be good to go ONLINE only after passing the OFFLINE checks. Besides you can use different offline metrics according to your RecSys goals and some of these metrics are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diversity:** We need to explore and exploit recommendations so we can burst the user's bubles a little bit and explore new tastes. So diversity is as important metric to track and is one way to calculate this is by the average of `1 - the sum of item similarities score` of each user's recommendation list (Intra-List-Similarity).\n",
    "* **Coverage:** This is the metric that calculates the percentage of items/users are being recommended. RecSys are supposed to have good recommendations for every user and also explore all available content, so it could be calculated as the number of distinct items/users recommended divided by the total of items/users available.\n",
    "* **Serendipity:** This is the level of **surprising** recommendations the users are receiving on average. The calculations are similar to Diversity Intra-List-Similarity mentioned above, but it compares recommended items to items from **users history** rather than similarities between items within the recommendation list, so we can check whether the recommendations are too close to consumed items (hence less surprising stuff).\n",
    "* **Novelty:** Mean popularity rank of recommended items. It is related to the above metric as both are trying to measure how obvious the recommendations are, having the goal of explore and exploit the items in the catalog. If we think that usually there are popular items and niche items in a product/item catalog (Long Tail), novelty would show whether the recommendations are being generated mostly around popular items on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The balance between known (or popular) items and novelty is something to be careful about! Users tend to trust more in the recommendations when they are familiar with at least some of the items listed, so too much novelty could make users suspect that something is wrong even when is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some useful metrics...\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hit Rate**: If the TOP N list (where N is a pre-defined number like 5 or 10) has something the user has already consumed/liked, it could be considered a \"hit\", so it could be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\frac{SUM(hits)}{Users}$\n",
    "\n",
    "> We also could use Leave-One-Out approach which is similar to Hit-Rate but leaving one random item out of the testset and measure how often this excluded item is recommended. It is like a cross-validation approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average Reciprocal Hit Rate (ARHR)**: It is also similar to Hit Rate but accounts for the position of the items, so it penalizes relevant items when they are in lower positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\frac{SUM(Reciprocal Rank)}{Users}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Reciprocal Rank (RR) is like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rank 1 = RR 1<br>\n",
    "Rank 2 = RR 1/2<br>\n",
    "Rank 3 = RR 1/3<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ranking Metrics:** Many ranking problems outside of RecSys also use some metrics to evaluate the Top N from a given list of items. Metrics such as `precision@K`, `recall@K`, `f1-score@K`, `MAP` and `NDCG` are great for those ranked lists and more detailed explanations can be found on [this](https://queirozf.com/entries/evaluation-metrics-for-ranking-problems-introduction-and-examples) post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some implementations from `sklearn` of [MAP](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html) and [NDCG](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ndcg_score.html) scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 - Some additional things....\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reliability:** Why should users trust in your recommendations? This is something that Amazon and others usually try to solve by explaning **why** a particular recommendation are presented there, whether it is based on the user's last purchase, last viewed or accessed product and it also enables them to fix and improve the recommendations by removing these items from their list. For example: It could be a one-time gift that does not represent the user's actuall taste.\n",
    "* **Churn:** How often do recommendations change for the users? If the same recommendation is repeatedly appearing for the same user even when he/she has not interacted with it, maybe we could be using this slot in a better way by giving some space for other recommendations. This would be a great chance to explore more items from the catalog and try new tastes for the users. \n",
    "* **Resposiveness:** How quickly does new user behavior influence your recommendations? The system should be robust enough to not change everything just because a small change has happened in user's behavior (e.g. weekends x working days) but it also should be sensitive enough to capture users's major changes/new interactions as quickly as possible. It could be related to how often the calculations are made (Nightly Job Runs, Once in a week, etc).\n",
    "* **Context:** Some external context could affect the user's behavior and it could be used as an input to the system so it can improve user's experience. For example: Depending on the device used, weather, weekday, seasonality and special dates, the system could adapt its recommendations to something that makes more sense in that context. So when you access your Netflix from your mobile device, maybe you are not willing to watch a long movie and could be looking for some short episode of your favorite show instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cold Start Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems suffer from <u>Cold Start Problem</u> which is when you have a new user or item and don't have enough data yet to provide any useful recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of new user, there are some discussions about how to deal with it like using `non-personalized recommendations` (Top Sellers, Trending Topics, etc). Popular items are popular for some reason right? So they should get attention of a larger group of people. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also can use some `semi-personalized` recommendations like getting user's geo-location from their IP and figure out where they are coming from and show popular items considering their regions for example, or we can simply ask them direclty some useful information or ratings that he/she would give for a particular item during the sign-up process, so we can assign them to a certain group (cluster) of similar people and generate group-based recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly content-based recommendations, exploration techniques like `multi armed bandit` and deep learning with RNNs approaches could be useful specially considering the user's current activies and visited items. Depending on the context it could do a great job, even when the user is not logged on your website/platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "For New Items the issue is a little bit different because it could take a long time until people start consuming it and hence it starts to show up on the recommendation lists, but by having an entire session of your UI only for recent added items can help you to address this. Another approach that could help on this could be randomly mixing some recent items into the final recommendation lists, so if we have 10 slots to fill up with recommendations, we could use 8 of them and let the remaining two for recent items that are more close to the user's taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this could be tested in different versions of your recommender with ONLINE tests to check which one is the best for each business case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal Effect: \n",
    "\n",
    "Your recent data is a stroger evidence of your current preferences, so applying some `decay function` that exponentially drops depending on the data recency could improve your recommendations quality, specially if the content are very time-sensitive as the user's tastes might change/evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and practical `decay function` could be: \n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\frac{interaction value -1}{(time(in days/month/year) + 2)^G}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where G is soome gravity constant (I usually use 1.8) and interaction value could be both implicit or explicit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frauds and Outliers: \n",
    "\n",
    "Bots, web crawlers, fake users and Internal Tests can affect the recommendations and similiarities calculations. One way to prevent this is removing *outliers* from the training set and/or check how much you can trust in a certain user's ratings by assessing his/her knowledge about the rated item, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trying to keep only consumed items in the data if the UI/System allows users rate unseen movies for example. For implicit data it would be good to perform some `sanity check` to evaluate if the tracking data are correctly capturing the users interactions.\n",
    "2. Implementing some mechanism to ask users things about the item that we already know the answer in order to check the user's knowlegde about the item and also confirm whether he/she is actually a real user, specially in their first interactions. Therefore a level of trust could be calculated based on the answers and used as a weight in this user's ratings so we can refine our similarities calculations as well as the recommendations generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stoplists/Whitelists: \n",
    "Is there any item that you should or shouldn't be recommending regardless of the algorithms predictions? Maybe so..\n",
    "That's why we can have a stoplist/blacklist and a whiteist/wishlist to control those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unethical content like: Porn, Illegal, Cultural matters, Political questions, you name it. For any of these contents, a deeper analysis might be worth. Another example could be an online drugstore recommender that cannot suggest any controled medicine, so these items should be included in a stoplist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite is also true: Is there something the company wants to promote like a new original movie from Netflix or free books ads on Amazon? This could be included in recommendations even when is not part of the calculations, so it is kind of a \"must have list\". "

    "After all this discussions we can see that Recommender Systems is not just about predicting ratings and it has many aspects to work on both from business and technical standpoints. It is a very *customer-driven* field, therefore we have to be constantly evaluating it with Online/field tests getting feedback from real users. It is like a `Lego` that you put many blocks together, each one with its own goal so you can build a whole **system** that is able to help people finding relevant items as well as helping companies to make more money, but it is not just about profit, it is about retain customers by knowing what they like and need. It is a win-win game after all.\n",
